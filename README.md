# Readmitted-Rate
--------
**_Patients readmitted rate_**, which is a **supervised learning** classification problem. <br>
Using a combination of models **(KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Perceptron and Naïve Bayes algorithms）** to deal with the real-world datasets from UCI machine learning lab. 
After cleaning and hyper tuning, ensemble results and get the best accuracy.
